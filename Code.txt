Perfect. You're at the right place â€” just **1 step away from fixing** this cleanly.

---

## ðŸš¨ Root Cause:

APT is failing because there's a **conflict between your old `libnode-dev` from Node 12** and the **new Node 18 `.deb`** package:

```
trying to overwrite '/usr/include/node/common.gypi', which is also in package libnode-dev 12.22.9
```

---

## âœ… Solution: Force Remove Conflicting Package & Reinstall

### 1. **Remove the old conflicting packages**

```bash
sudo apt purge -y libnode-dev nodejs npm
sudo rm -rf /opt/nodejs /usr/local/bin/node /usr/local/bin/npm
```

---

### 2. **Clean up package manager**

```bash
sudo apt autoremove -y
sudo apt clean
```

---

### 3. **Install Node.js v18 properly**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

This will install both **node** and **npm** into `/usr/bin`.

---

### 4. **Test installation**

```bash
node -v     # Should print v18.x
npm -v      # Should print something like 9.x or 10.x
which npm   # Should point to /usr/bin/npm
```

---

### 5. (Optional) Reinstall PM2

```bash
sudo npm install -g pm2
```

---

### ðŸ’¡ Bonus: Lock it Down

If you want to **lock Node 18** from future upgrades:

```bash
sudo apt-mark hold nodejs
```

---

Let me know once `node -v` and `npm -v` work cleanly â€” then you're good to build the frontend!
