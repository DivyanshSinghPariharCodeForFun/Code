Ah ‚Äî you‚Äôre asking about **standalone Node.js binary install**, not NVM. Got it. This is the **most forceful, root-level method** ‚Äî perfect for when you're stuck on Node v12 system-wide and want to overwrite it **without relying on package managers** like APT or NVM.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Steps to Forcefully Install Node.js via Standalone Binary (v22.x)

1. **Go to Node.js official site** and get the latest Linux x64 binary (you can skip this if you have the link):

   üëâ [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

   Or use `wget` directly:

   ```bash
   wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.2.0/node-v22.2.0-linux-x64.tar.xz
   ```

2. **Extract the archive**:

   ```bash
   tar -xf node-v22.2.0-linux-x64.tar.xz
   ```

3. **Move it to `/usr/local` (or wherever you want to globally install)**:

   ```bash
   sudo mv node-v22.2.0-linux-x64 /usr/local/node22
   ```

4. **Add it to your path permanently**:

   Edit `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

   Add this at the bottom:

   ```bash
   export PATH=/usr/local/node22/bin:$PATH
   ```

   Then reload:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. **Verify**:

   ```bash
   node -v   # Should show v22.2.0
   npm -v
   ```

### üß® Want to Completely Wipe System Node (Optional)?

If apt installed node v12 and you want to nuke it:

```bash
sudo apt purge nodejs npm
sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/node /usr/bin/npm /usr/lib/node_modules
```

---

### ‚úÖ Final Outcome:

You'll now be running **Node.js v22 from `/usr/local/node22/bin`**, completely independent of apt or nvm. Ultra clean.

Let me know if you want me to generate a one-liner script to automate this all.
