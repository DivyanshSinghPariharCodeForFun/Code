💥 **Your NGINX issue is 100% a file permissions problem.**

---

### 🚨 Error Breakdown:

```
stat() "...index.html" failed (13: Permission denied)
```

This means NGINX **doesn’t have permission** to read the files inside:

```
/opt/erapp/frontend/build/
```

---

### ✅ Solution:

Run this to fix **read access** for NGINX:

```bash
sudo chmod -R o+r /opt/erapp/frontend/build
sudo chmod -R o+x /opt/erapp/frontend/build
sudo find /opt/erapp/frontend/build -type d -exec chmod o+x {} \;
```

Then make sure the whole directory path is **executable** (for traversal):

```bash
sudo chmod o+x /opt
sudo chmod o+x /opt/erapp
sudo chmod o+x /opt/erapp/frontend
```

---

### ⚠️ NGINX User Access Check:

Check which user NGINX is running as:

```bash
ps aux | grep nginx
```

Usually it’s `www-data`. Ensure it has **access rights** to the folder.

You can also explicitly **change ownership or add permissions**:

```bash
sudo chown -R root:www-data /opt/erapp/frontend/build
sudo chmod -R 755 /opt/erapp/frontend/build
```

---

### 🔁 Finally, restart NGINX:

```bash
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

Let me know if you’re using SELinux or AppArmor — it may need additional allow rules. But this fix should resolve the 403-style “permission denied” errors.
