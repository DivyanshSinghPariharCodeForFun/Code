Perfect — you're very close. Here's **exactly what’s happening**:

---

### 💥 Problem

Even though `npm` is now installed properly and lives in `/usr/bin/npm`, your terminal is still trying to run:

```
/opt/nodejs/bin/npm
```

But that path **doesn’t exist anymore**, hence:

```bash
bash: /opt/nodejs/bin/npm: No such file or directory
```

This means your system’s **PATH or alias** is polluted — it's looking for a **non-existent npm** in `/opt/nodejs/bin`.

---

### ✅ Fix It Cleanly (2-Minute Operation)

#### 1. **Find & Remove the faulty alias / old path**

Run:

```bash
which npm
type npm
```

If it shows `/opt/nodejs/bin/npm` in either, we need to **kill that override**.

---

#### 2. **Search for rogue PATH in your shell config**

Run:

```bash
grep -E '/opt/nodejs/bin' ~/.bashrc ~/.profile ~/.bash_profile ~/.zshrc 2>/dev/null
```

If you see something like:

```bash
export PATH=/opt/nodejs/bin:$PATH
```

Then remove it:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
# or ~/.profile depending on what the above command showed
```

Delete the `export PATH=/opt/nodejs/bin:$PATH` line.

Then apply:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
hash -r
```

---

#### 3. **Confirm Cleanup**

Run:

```bash
which npm
npm -v
```

You should now get:

```
/usr/bin/npm
10.x.x
```

---

#### ✅ BONUS CLEANUP

To fully remove old `/opt/nodejs` crap:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /opt/nodejs
```

This will **permanently delete** the broken path that was haunting your system.

### Summary (David Style 🔱):

| ✅ Step             | Action                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧹 Clean shell     | Remove `/opt/nodejs/bin` path from `.bashrc`           |
| 🔁 Reset session   | `source ~/.bashrc && hash -r`                          |
| ❌ Kill zombie path | `rm -rf /opt/nodejs`                                   |
| 🎯 Final check     | `which npm && npm -v` → should point to `/usr/bin/npm` |

---

Let me know when `npm -v` runs cleanly — then we do the `pm2`, and finally build+run. Let's wrap this beast.
