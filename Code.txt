Fantastic! ðŸŽ‰  
If your server is running on port 3000 and you can access your app, that means your deployment is now successful.

---

## **What to do next:**

1. **Test All Features**
   - Log in, create, edit, and view all parts of your app.
   - Try direct URL access to React routes (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/create_frequency`, etc.).
   - Test backend endpoints (e.g., `/login`, `/register`, `/hods`, etc.).

2. **Monitor Logs**
   - Keep an eye on logs for any unexpected errors:
     ```bash
     pm2 logs er-backend
     sudo tail -n 30 /var/log/nginx/error.log
     ```

3. **(Optional) Secure Your Server**
   - Make sure only ports 80/443 (and 22 for SSH) are open.
   - Set up automatic restarts for PM2:
     ```bash
     pm2 save
     pm2 startup
     ```

4. **(Optional) Set Up Backups**
   - Regularly back up your MongoDB data and important files.

---

## **If You Need to Deploy Updates:**
- Pull new code.
- Rebuild frontend:
  ```bash
  cd /opt/ER_Linux/frontend
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```
- Restart backend:
  ```bash
  pm2 restart er-backend
  ```

**If you hit any issues or need help with anything else (Nginx, SSL, MongoDB, etc.), just ask!**

Congratulations on getting your app running! ðŸš€
