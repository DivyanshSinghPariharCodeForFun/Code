You have two main issues in your Nginx error log:

---

## 1. **SSL Certificate Not Found**
```
cannot load certificate "/etc/ssl/religare/religare.in.crt": BIO_new_file() failed (SSL: error:80000002:system library::No such file or directory:calling fopen(/etc/ssl/religare/religare.in.crt, r)
```
**What this means:**  
Nginx cannot find your SSL certificate file at `/etc/ssl/religare/religare.in.crt`.

**How to fix:**
- Make sure the file `/etc/ssl/religare/religare.in.crt` exists and is readable by Nginx.
- If your certificate is in a different location or has a different name, update your Nginx config accordingly:
  ```nginx
  ssl_certificate /path/to/your/cert.crt;
  ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/cert.key;
  ```
- If you don’t have a certificate, you can use a self-signed one for testing, or use Let’s Encrypt for a free cert.

---

## 2. **Rewrite or Internal Redirection Cycle**
```
rewrite or internal redirection cycle while internally redirecting to "/index.html"
```
**What this means:**  
Nginx is stuck in a loop trying to serve `/index.html`, likely because `/index.html` does not exist or is not readable.

**How to fix:**
- Make sure `/opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build/index.html` exists and is readable by the Nginx user (`www-data`).
- Check permissions:
  ```bash
  ls -l /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build/index.html
  ```
  Should be at least `-rw-r--r--` and owned by `www-data`.
- If the file is missing, rebuild your frontend:
  ```bash
  cd /opt/ER_Linux/frontend
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```
- If the file exists, but you still get the error, check your Nginx config for the `location /` block:
  ```nginx
  location / {
      try_files $uri /index.html;
  }
  ```
  This is correct, but only if `/index.html` exists.

## **Summary Table**

| Error                                   | Cause                        | Fix                                      |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| SSL cert not found                       | Wrong/missing cert path      | Fix path or generate cert                |
| Redirection cycle to /index.html         | Missing/unreadable index.html| Rebuild frontend, fix permissions        |

## **What to do next:**

1. **Fix the SSL certificate path or generate a valid cert.**
2. **Ensure `/opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build/index.html` exists and is readable.**
3. **Reload Nginx:**
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```
4. **Test your site again.**

**If you need help generating a self-signed cert or fixing permissions, let me know!**  
If you still see errors, paste the output of:  
```bash
ls -l /opt/ER_Linux/frontend/build/index.html
```  
and I’ll help you further!
