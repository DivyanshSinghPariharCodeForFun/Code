Perfect â€” here's exactly what to type **step-by-step** to connect to your `restrict_app` MongoDB **with authentication**, then insert your `admin` user.

## âœ… Step-by-Step With Auth

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 1: Full Authenticated Connect Command**

```bash
mongosh "mongodb://restrict_user:random@localhost:27017/restrict_app"
```

> ðŸ”‘ This logs you into the `restrict_app` database **as `restrict_user`** with password `random`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 2: Confirm Youâ€™re in Right DB**

Once inside `mongosh`, run:

```js
db
```

It should output:

```js
restrict_app
```

If not, switch manually:

```js
use restrict_app
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 3: Insert LDAP Admin User**

```js
db.user.insertOne({
  name: "divyansh",
  email: "divyansh@religare.com",
  password: null,
  role: "admin",
  authType: "ldap",
  status: true,
  deleted_at: null,
  created_at: new Date(),
  updated_at: new Date()
});
```

You should see:

```js
{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedId: ObjectId("...")
}
```

---

## ðŸ§  Reminder

* You do **not** need to manually select DB by typing `restrict_app` â€” that wonâ€™t work.
* Use `use restrict_app` after connecting if you're not already in it.

Let me know if you want to convert this to a Bash script or cronjob.
