To fix **permission issues** with your React `build/` folder (especially if you're getting 403 or 404), run these commands from your frontend directory:

---

### ✅ Give Full Read Access to NGINX

```bash
cd /opt/erapp/frontend

# Make sure build directory exists
sudo mkdir -p build

# Make sure everything inside build is readable
sudo chmod -R 755 build
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data build
```

---

### 🔐 If You're Unsure About Web Server User

For **Ubuntu NGINX**, it typically runs as `www-data`. You can confirm using:

```bash
ps aux | grep nginx
```

If it shows:

```bash
www-data  ...
```

You're good. Otherwise, replace `www-data` above with whatever user is running NGINX.

---

### ⚠️ Also Set Permissions for Whole Frontend Path

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /opt/erapp/frontend
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/erapp/frontend
```

---

### 🔁 Then Restart NGINX

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

---

### 🚀 Final Test

Now reload your browser:

```
https://10.91.31.57/
```

If permissions were the problem, your CSS/JS files will now load properly.

---

Let me know if you want to *log permission errors live* from NGINX (`/var/log/nginx/error.log`) for more root cause debugging.
