‚ö†Ô∏è **You're getting this because `npm` is broken in your Node.js v22 standalone install.** Specifically:

```bash
Error: Cannot find module '../lib/cli.js'
```

This usually means:

* You **only downloaded Node.js**, not the full Node + NPM bundle.
* Or `npm` is **not correctly symlinked** or installed alongside Node.

---

### ‚úÖ Fix Options

#### ‚úÖ Option 1: Download the Full Node.js Binary with NPM bundled

If you're doing offline installs, make sure you **download the full bundle that includes `npm`**, not just `node`.

> Use this for **Linux x64**:
> **üëâ [https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.2.0/node-v22.2.0-linux-x64.tar.xz](https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.2.0/node-v22.2.0-linux-x64.tar.xz)**

This includes:

* `node`
* `npm`
* all binaries under `/bin`

#### Steps:

1. Extract it locally:

   ```bash
   tar -xf node-v22.2.0-linux-x64.tar.xz
   ```

2. Move it to `/opt/nodejs`:

   ```bash
   sudo mv node-v22.2.0-linux-x64 /opt/nodejs
   ```

3. Add to your PATH:

   ```bash
   export PATH=/opt/nodejs/bin:$PATH
   ```

4. Test:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

‚úÖ This `npm` will now work properly.

#### ‚ùå Don't Use Custom-Compiled Node Without Full Libs

The error you‚Äôre facing:

```bash
Cannot find module '../lib/cli.js'
```

...is because you're calling `npm` directly from a half-broken binary directory (`/opt/nodejs/bin/npm`), but `lib/cli.js` isn‚Äôt there.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Check:

Does this exist?

```bash
ls /opt/nodejs/lib/node_modules/npm
```

If not ‚Üí your install is **incomplete**.

Let me know if you want me to bundle and upload a zip that works with Node + NPM pre-wired for Ubuntu.
